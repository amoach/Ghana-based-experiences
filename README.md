## Code Institute: Milestone Project 1 - Amanda Achampong

Ghana based. Experiences is a booking agent specifically for Ghana, in order for those wanting to book things to do
whilst in Ghana. So it is mainly targeted at young tourists with a demographic of 18-30 year olds.
This was also thought about when designing the overall theme of the website.

# Project Requirements:

Create a user centric website using front end technologies - HTML5 - CSS3 and supporting libraries such as Bootstrap.

# Strategy and Scope
## UX

#### Business Objectives

- The website will provide information on various discounted activities to book and do in Ghana alongside third parties.
- The user will be able to access booking team online via the contact form to gain more booking information and any queries they may have. 
- Informed information will be made clearly available on all the offered activities which can be booked with Ghana based.

#### User Objectives

- Engage with anyone visiting Ghana looking for new experiences and activities to do in Ghana
- Users can contact for a bespoke experience according to their reason for booking.

#### Project Goals

- Creating a clear, aesthetically pleasing website which is also easily navigatable for the user.
- Having a theme which is consistent throughout the website.
- Including all relevant information in regards to the services provided alongside any other navigational things which compliment the user experience

# Structure

- Starts with the homepage 
- Ultimately the user would want to first of all find out about all the different experiences that can be booked on the site, therefore, pages to a couple of them can also be accessed on the homepage while scrolling in a gallery like format.
- Pages which can be accessed include the different experiences, about page, gallery and a contact page. Navigation menu bar also makes it easy to access to all pages regardless which page the user is on.

## Design Process

- Initial research was done in order to see how other competitors went about their website design.
- The wireframe was then designed on figma which made it easy to visualize as well as successfully make it consistent throughout.
- The overall aim was to show the user the beauty and amazing things Ghana has to offer and therefore having a gallery like concept and feel to all pages was the best way to showcase it all. Allowing the user to see the photos clearly in big enough photos to really give the intial feel of what Ghana is about.
- End to end photos on the homepage alongside a continuous scroll was also thought to be a good feature in order to give a good first impression and insight from the get go.
- The gallery like theme was continued onto the other pages in order to keep it all consistent and still giving that showcasing Ghana feel. So on the experiences pages, there are the photos in a single column of what to expect alongside the text explaining it all. This again was intended to have that continuous feel as you scroll down to find out more.
- Contact page could not have a photo to illustrate and therefore contains the first image from the homepage as the background. This keeps it consistent as well as making it an overall appealling page to be on.

#### Page Structure

* I wanted the site to remain simple and easy to navigate, therefore the use of sections was kept to a minimum on each page. Most of the pages remain viewable in full without scrolling when using a desktop device. The reason for this design choice, is to achieve the purpose set out to make the user experience quick and easy to locate the information they require.

* With the exception of the homepage, all pages consist of the same structure when it comes to the logo at the header, navigation bar at the top left and social media link buttons at the bottom right of footer. 

* Homepage has images with buttons in order to navigate the relevant pages according to the images and these include about, contact, festivals and elmina.

* Fixed responsive hamburger navbar at the top left of each page contains links to all pages. The 'Experiences' section also has a dropdown when clicked and the different experiences can be accessed on all pages. The navbar has a contrasting colour depending on the page and collaspsible. It also floats on mobile devices as you scroll and menu also then takes up the full width of the screen.

#### Home

* The Homepage has button features which enables you to navigate four different pages, along with the navbar at top left side:

#### About us 

* The about us page consists of two sections:

    1. The first you have a polaroid like photo of the founders - which I own the rights to.

    2. The next section is all the relevant information of the aims of Ghana based experiences sets out to achieve

#### Contact

## Wireframe designs

* The wireframes were designed using Figma. I started with a single home page design, worked on developing a page structure which would support the requirements of the home page.
