Ghana based. Experiences is a booking agent specifically for Ghana, in order for those wanting to book things to do
whilst in Ghana. So it is mainly targeted at young tourists with a demographic of 18-30 year olds.
This was also thought about when designing the overall theme of the website.

Live version of the website can be accessed here: (https://amoach.github.io/Ghana-based/)

# Project Requirements:

Create a user centric website using front end technologies - HTML5 - CSS3 and supporting libraries such as Bootstrap.

# Strategy and Scope
## UX

#### Business Objectives

- The website will provide information on various discounted activities to book and do in Ghana alongside third parties.
- The user will be able to access booking team online via the contact form to gain more booking information and any queries they may have. 
- Informed information will be made clearly available on all the offered activities which can be booked with Ghana based.

#### User Objectives

- Engage with anyone visiting Ghana looking for new experiences and activities to do in Ghana
- Users can contact for a bespoke experience according to their reason for booking.

#### Project Goals

- Creating a clear, aesthetically pleasing website which is also easily navigatable for the user.
- Having a theme which is consistent throughout the website.
- Including all relevant information in regards to the services provided alongside any other navigational things which compliment the user experience

# Structure

- Starts with the homepage 
- Ultimately the user would want to first of all find out about all the different experiences that can be booked on the site, therefore, pages to a couple of them can also be accessed on the homepage while scrolling in a gallery like format.
- Pages which can be accessed include the different experiences, about page, gallery and a contact page. Navigation menu bar also makes it easy to access to all pages regardless which page the user is on.

## Design Process

- Initial research was done in order to see how other competitors went about their website design.
- The wireframe was then designed on figma which made it easy to visualize as well as successfully make it consistent throughout.
- The overall aim was to show the user the beauty and amazing things Ghana has to offer and therefore having a gallery like concept and feel to all pages was the best way to showcase it all. Allowing the user to see the photos clearly in big enough photos to really give the intial feel of what Ghana is about.
- End to end photos on the homepage alongside a continuous scroll was also thought to be a good feature in order to give a good first impression and insight from the get go.
- The gallery like theme was continued onto the other pages in order to keep it all consistent and still giving that showcasing Ghana feel. So on the experiences pages, there are the photos in a single column of what to expect alongside the text explaining it all. This again was intended to have that continuous feel as you scroll down to find out more.
- Contact page could not have a photo to illustrate and therefore contains the first image from the homepage as the background. This keeps it consistent as well as making it an overall appealling page to be on.

#### Page Structure

* I wanted the site to remain simple and easy to navigate, therefore the use of sections was kept to a minimum on each page. Most of the pages remain viewable in full without scrolling when using a desktop device. The reason for this design choice, is to achieve the purpose set out to make the user experience quick and easy to locate the information they require.

* With the exception of the homepage, all pages consist of the same structure when it comes to the logo at the header, navigation bar at the top left and social media link buttons at the bottom right of footer. 

* Homepage has images with buttons in order to navigate the relevant pages according to the images and these include about, contact, festivals and elmina.

* Fixed responsive hamburger navbar at the top left of each page contains links to all pages. The 'Experiences' section also has a dropdown when clicked and the different experiences can be accessed on all pages. The navbar has a contrasting colour depending on the page and collaspsible. It also floats on mobile devices as you scroll and menu also then takes up the full width of the screen.

#### Home

* The Homepage has button features which enables you to navigate four different pages, along with the navbar at top left side:

    1. First image is of Cape coast beach with buttons to take you to the the about and contact pages. Image was taken from here: (https://unsplash.com/photos/OOOLSgre3RE?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditShareLink)

#### About us 

* The about us page consists of two sections:

    1. The first you have a polaroid like photo of the founders - which I own the rights to.

    2. The next section is all the relevant information of the aims of Ghana based experiences sets out to achieve

#### Festivals

* The page is sectioned off to 2 columns with the photos on the left side and text on the right. User is then able to access the contact page and book that experience by clicking the 'BOOK' button beneath the text.

#### Contact

* Contact page consists of the logo header, image background and contact form with required fields.


## Wireframe designs

* The wireframes were created in Photoshop in order to get all the screenshots on the same page

* The screenshots were taken from a desktop screen of 1183px x 821px

## Responsive Design

All wireframe were created to a large sized desktop display and other screen sizes were then worked on to ensure responsiveness. And this included mobile size for iphone x and larger screen size of 1270px x 815px
This required me to decide how best the content should be displayed on smaller devices. I ensured to keep the 'user' at the heart of any design choices. Making decisions on content order was important, as less content is viewable on smaller screen sizes without the need to scroll. To ensure engagement was maintained and users are able to find key content quickly, some content was shifted or even removed on smaller screens, using responsive design.

# Surface

## Colours

Colour Palette - I chose three colours which were either taken from the photos used on the website or just one I thought would work well with the theme and be complimentary to the overall look. I also ensured there was continuity throughout the site.

- ![#4d6871](https://via.placeholder.com/15/4d6871/000000?text=+) `#4d6871` - Button hover
- ![#8A6C00](https://via.placeholder.com/15/8A6C00/000000?text=+) `#8A6C00` - Logo, body text, social media buttons and contact form
- ![#FFFFFF](https://via.placeholder.com/15/FFFFFF/000000?text=+) `#FFFFFF`- Homepage logo, buttons and social media button logos

There were also greys used for some things like the background overlay of home buttons and text of navbar dropdown menu.

### Nav Bar

* Collaspsible hamburger navbar from bootstrap is used across the site across all devices

* Fixed at the top left corner as the default position users are familiar in navigating. Created to float and scroll along as the user scrolls down the page for easy access to the menu regardless where they are on the page.


### Contact Information

* Users have the option of contacting via the contact page and this goes for any queries they may have as well as making a booking of their choice.

## Languages

* HTML 
* CSS 

## Libraries

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (4.2.1) - Responsiveness, styling and navbar.
* [FontAwseome](https://fontawesome.com/) (5.15.1) - Icons for the social media links.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Google Roboto font.
* [Unsplash] (http://unsplash.com/) - Most images used across the site.

## Tools

* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) 
* [Github](https://github.com/) - hosting repository and website.
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - used for creation of wireframes.
* [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) - used to test the website and screenshot was taken for the top of README page.
* [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) - used for testing and debugging.
* [w3 html validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - used to validate my html code.
* [w3 css validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) - used to validate my css code.

## Testing Features
**
    * The navbar was tested to collapse as well as with the dropdown menu.
    * Different screen sizes were looked at in order to see how the responsiveness is on different devices.
    * Nav links were tested to ensure they were being correctly linked to the intended external sites.
    * Friend was also asked to preview the site on his xl screen and iphone 5 device.

## Testing responsiveness

- Using Google Chrome Dev Tools all pages were viewed in the responsive setting to display various screen sizes. 

## Testing different browsers

I tested the website on the following web browsers:
- Google Chrome 
- Mozilla Firefox 

## Validating the HTML and CSS code

All of my code passed the following validation tests:
- HTML: [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- CSS: [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

Screenshots of validations for each page of code can be found [here](https://github.com/jamie120/ms1_d_r_plastering/blob/master/assets/images/testing)

## Issues 

* There were various HTML validation issues to resolve. These mainly referred to formatting my code and were easily fixable across the site.

* Making the site responsive to the different screen sizes turned out to be difficult and not fully executed in the end. In order to tackle this I added various different media queries in the css.

* There are some overflow issues especially when it comes to the different screen sizes. This was attempted to be fixed by adjusting margins and implementing bootstrap, however due to lack of time, was not fully executed.

* Nav Bar was very difficult to get styled and working as it is now. Tutor support, heavily relying on devtools and taking on various techniques, that was fixed and was able to function and styled in the desired way. 


# Deployment

* The site was coded in GitPod and then pushed onto GitHub repository - [REPO](https://github.com/jamie120/ms1_d_r_plastering)
    * The following GIT commands were used throughout deployment:
        * **git status** - to identify any changes yet to be commited.
        * **git add .** - to stage files ready to commit.
        * **git commit -m " "** - to commit the specific files for logging purposes.
        * **git push** - push all files onto final respository in Github.

## Content

I am responsible for all content and code written.
